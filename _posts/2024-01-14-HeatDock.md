project_name: Heat & Hot Dock

header_caption: During the TACR TK04020326 project, I worked as a programmer for the Heat and Hot Dock emulator. The Heat Dock emulator is utilized for comprehensive dynamic testing of energy systems, where equipment such as heat pumps is connected to the heat source circuit, and any external cooling device with sufficient capacity is linked to the cooling source circuit. This circuit emulates the heat demand of a real-world building. The Hot Dock emulator facilitates testing of DHW storage tanks and operates in conjunction with concurrent building simulations, providing a realistic representation of various DHW load profiles.

long_text: The setup for both emulators includes the Tecomat PLC - central unit CP 2005, along with sub-modules IT-1604 and IB-1301. These sub-modules are interconnected via the TCL2 bus to the central unit. For remote management and data handling, the PLCs are permanently accessible online via TecoRoute service. In Heat Dock, emulation is achieved using a three-way mixing valve, which adjusts to an output temperature corresponding to the return temperature of an actual heating system. The desired outlet temperature is derived from the simulation of the building's real heating system in the TRNSYS simulation environment. Flow rate control on the heat source side operates on the same principle. Hot Dock utilizes three-way mixing valve and a speed-controlled pump. Communication between TRNSYS and the Heat and Hot Dock controller is facilitated through dedicated communication middleware.
