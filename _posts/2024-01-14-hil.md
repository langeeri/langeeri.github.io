project_name: HiL Testbed

header_caption: In CTU UCEEB's Heat Pump Laboratory, I have developed a Hardware-in-the-Loop testbed for testing heat pump systems with their controllers under realistic conditions. This method, distinct from conventional static tests, utilizes a concurrent building simulation to dynamically emulate real-world conditions, allowing for a comprehensive efficiency analysis and the integration of advanced control algorithms.

long_text_header: Design 
long_text: The testbed utilizes the heat pump laboratory's system, augmented with space heating and DHW emulators connected to a concurrent building simulation. The physical communication layer consists of a laboratory server communicating over Ethernet with multiple connected PLCs. This server runs a simulation program, communication middleware, and an dedicated HTTP server. Communication between the simulation program and the PLCs is facilitated by python middleware specifically developed for this purpose. The middleware uses the CFFI library for data exchange with the simulation kernel written in Fortran. During the simulation's initialization in the middleware, ModBus clients are opened, ensuring subsequent data transfer from the middleware to the individual PLCs via the ModBus TCP/IP protocol. Each PLC operates as a separate ModBus server.
