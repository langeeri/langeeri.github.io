header_caption: Type 201 is a versatile TRNSYS component designed for simulating a heating/cooling element in thermal systems. It dynamically adjusts its output based on flow rate and temperature conditions, making it useful for simulations involving variable operational conditions.

long_text_header: Design 
long_text: The model first checks if the flow rate is below a certain threshold. If so, it assumes no flow, sets heating/cooling output to zero, and maintains inlet temperature as the outlet temperature. If the flow rate is above the threshold, it calculates whether the system should heat or cool based on the average temperature compared to the design temperature. Depending on whether heating or cooling is needed, it calculates the outlet temperature and the respective heating or cooling output. The calculations involve the nominal parameters, the specific heat capacity, and the inlet and design temperatures.
