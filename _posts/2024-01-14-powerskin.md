header_caption: As part of the Powerskin+ project, I worked as a designer and PLC programmer for the experimental testing and monitoring of LaWin Glass. It is a small-scale system consisting of LaWin Glass, a storage tank, and an air heater (heat sink). The installation aims to conduct research on thermally active façades.

long_text: The solar system consists of LaWin glass panes, a storage tank, and a Volcano air heater. The process fluid is monoethylene glycol. Circulation of the process fluid between the LaWin glass and the storage tank, and between the storage tank and the air heater, is ensured by a circulation pump. The system operates at notably low pressures and flow rates. The control setup includes the Tecomat PLC CP 2005, along with sub-modules IT-1604 and IB-1301 for temperature and flow rate sensing. These sub-modules are interconnected via the TCL2 bus to the PLC. For remote management and data handling, the PLC is permanently accessible online through the TecoRoute service.
